<meta name="citation_abstract" content="In Carnatic music, Yati patterns are the decorative features used in different compositional forms. The patterns are named after the shape they seem like. The existing patterns are Mridanga, Damaru, Sama, Gopuccha, Srotovaha and Vishama yatis. In the present composition, a new yati called the Taranga has been introduced.  

Pattern examples for Yatis:
Mridanga - 5 6 7 6 5; Damaru- 5 4 3 2 3 4 5; Sama -  4 4 4 4;Gopuccha – shape of a cow tail – 5 4 3 2 1; Srotovaha – water stream- 1 2 3 4 5; Vishama – irregular -  4 6 2 3 1;Taranga – waves, tides -  4 6 4 6 4 (or) 5 4  5  4  5

Composition structure: This composition is the combination of various yati patterns. 
The tala chosen is Adi talam, which has 8 beats. Taking four counts on each beat, every cycle counts for 32 matras. The yatis are chosen in such a way that they fit to this 32 tala cycle.The execution of the song begins with singing the notation, to present the yati patterns clearly. The same arrangement will be played on percussion too. The song has:

Pallavi: Mridanga and Sama Yatis (4 5 6 5 4 and 2 2  2  2).
Charanam 1: (4  3  2   4  3 2    4 3 2,   2.5  2.5,   6  7  8   and  3  2  1  2  3)
3(Gopucha) + Sama +Srotovaha + Damaru
Charanam 2:   (4 6 4 6 4,   3 1 2 1 1,   5 3 5 3 5,    3 2 1 2 3)
Taranga + Vishama+Tarnga+ Damaru 

Kolam is presented with the same number of dots as the calculation in the yati while the song is being sung. It represents the shapes after which the yatis were named. An attempt is made to match these shapes to those of popular musical instruments. Kolam gets executed in the same time duration with the same yati patterns as that of each section of the song. After every section of the composition, there is a percussion solo with the combination of some yatis that perfectly fit to the 32 tala cycle. Names of the yatis are the lyrics of the composition. 
Note: The song is recorded LIVE without any cut, paste or editing. The three performers performed together at the same time.
