#### Author: Ranaprathap Ponnam (High school graduate)
This sound box is a best-out-of-waste invention. The outer material is a used water can. Some of the electronics are picked up from damaged devices, while the others were purchased separately. The speaker has a Bluetooth kit, a woofer, subwoofer, tweeter. It is powered with a 12V AC supply, which can also be powered with a battery. The internal PCB board is a two-channel 4440 IC as audio power amplifier board. The IC4440 has a built-in bass, treble and volume controls. The 100k ohm potentiometer is used for the bass control and two 47k ohm potentiometers are used for treble and volume control. The speaker has an aux-in and a 6.3mm jack socket as inputs and are soldered manually to the audio board. The output sources i.e woofer, subwoofer and tweeter are also manually soldered to the audio board. This has been built for personal practice purposes as buying one from the market was not affordable.

### FUTURE IMPROVEMENTS:
-&gt; We are looking to add reverb and echo controls to our speaker. 
-&gt; We are looking to also add a RCA connector, through which this speaker can be connected to TVs for external audio. 

### PERFORMANCE PIECE:
The presented piece is a set of different beats that express the diversity of sound the sound box can support. The different genre names have been projected in the video during that particular beat. The artist is self – taught. This work can belong to the category of Live Ensemble also.

### NOTE:
The artist is from a remote background, with a lack of resources. Everything presented in the submission is self – developed.

 -&gt; He comes from a remote background, with lack of resources.
 -&gt; He is a self-taught beatboxer. He developed his interest in music when he was in 9th grade. His father being a performer of arts, the interest naturally developed in him. 
 -&gt; He mimics sounds of various musical instruments, as well as sounds of various birds and animals too. 
 -&gt; He has performed in various religious festivals, and exhibitions in and around his village and has won great laurels for his talent and innovation. He has also performed Beat-boxing at the prestigious Ravindra Bharati in Hyderabad. 
 -&gt; Apart from his musical ability, he is also an innovator. To amplify his beatbox, he designed and developed his own sound box from scrap materials. 
 -&gt; To save people from electrocutions in agricultural fields, he created an auto on /off motor. He has also created an egg hatching machine. To draw out water from heavy floods, he made a motor which draws out water with great efficiency. 
 -&gt; He was recently felicitated by the District officials, appreciating and acknowledging his great skill and innovation. 
 -&gt; He is an ardent admirer of the popular beatboxer, Tom Thum.</p></div>
