          <p>Symbolic music formats (e.g., MIDI, MusicXML/MEI) can provide a variety of high-level musical information like note pitch and duration, key/time signature, beat/downbeat position, etc. Such data can be used as both input/training data and as ground truth for MIR systems.</p>
<p>This tutorial aims to provide an introduction to symbolic music processing for a broad MIR audience, with a particular focus on showing how to extract relevant MIR features from symbolic musical formats in a fast, intuitive, and scalable way. We do this with the aid of the Python package Partitura. To target different kinds of symbolic data, we use an extended version of the ASAP Dataset, a multi-modal dataset that contains MusicXML scores, MIDI performances, audio performances, and score-to-performance alignments.</p>
<p>The tutorial will be structured in four parts: The first part provides an introduction to the topic of symbolic music processing. The second, third, and fourth parts are hands-on tutorials that showcase the structure of the Partitura package (including its relation to other popular Python packages for symbolic music processing), how to extract common MIR features, and how to work with symbolic multimodal datasets, respectively.</p>
<p>The motivation behind this tutorial is to promote research on symbolic music processing in the MIR community. Therefore, we target a broad audience of researchers without requiring prior knowledge of this particular area. For the hands-on parts of the tutorial, we presuppose some practical experience with the Python language, but we will provide well-documented step-by-step access to the code in the form of Google Colab notebooks, which will be made publicly available after the tutorial. Furthermore, some familiarity with the basic concepts of statistics and machine learning is useful.</p>

          <p>Culture-aware approaches to computational musicology and music information research (MIR) have been shown to be effective for a musically relevant analysis of a music culture. Projects such as CompMusic (2011-2017), MusicalBridges (2018-2022) or the initiatives funded by SPARC (2019-2022) have demonstrated the importance of considering sociocultural specifics of a music tradition to effectively define research problems, collect data and propose methods for analysis. These projects have made particularly notable contributions to the analysis of Indian Art Music (IAM), leading to a collective body of bespoke computational methods for analyzing these traditions.</p>
<p>Through this tutorial we aim to compile and present such works, making openly available a number of software tools and materials developed by MIR researchers working on the two main IAM traditions, Carnatic and Hindustani. The content will be organized into five sections: (1) datasets and corpora, (2) melodic analysis, (3) rhythmic analysis, (4) timbral analysis and (5) structural analysis. Each topic will include an introduction covering the basic musical concepts required to understand its constituent tasks, followed by a practical presentation of the materials and software tools compiled.</p>

          <p>Advances in deep learning and signal processing research have made it possible to generate signals that at times can be difficult to distinguish from real samples. Despite the realistic output the models can produce, however, the controllability of the models is still constrained because of the black-box-like nature of many models.</p>
<p>In this tutorial, we aim to introduce considerations researchers can take into account for a better end-user experience. We would like to focus in particular on how to design deep generative models with intuitive control of music audio signals, specifically vocal and instrumental performance. To this end, we will first present a broad review of up-to-date generative models for singing voices and musical instrument performance. Then, we will share our own research results and insights regarding both the implicit and explicit controllability of the deep learning models. In the section on presenting controllable models for instrumental performance synthesis, we will include a walk-through of the building, training, and control of the DDSP and MIDI-DDSP models via Jupyter (Colab) Notebook with Python and Tensorflow.</p>
<p>The target audience for this tutorial is researchers who are interested in deep generative models for monophonic signals, especially for singing voice and musical instruments. We expect the audience to have a basic understanding of machine learning concepts for audio signal processing.</p>

          <p>While deep neural networks achieved promising results in many MIR tasks, they typically require a large amount of labeled data for training. Rare, fine-grained, or newly emerged classes (e.g. a rare musical instrument, a new music genre) where large-scale data collection is hard or simply impossible are often considered out-of-vocabulary and unsupported by MIR systems. To address this, few-shot learning (FSL) and zero-shot learning (ZSL) are learning paradigms that aim to train a model that can learn a new concept based on just a handful of labeled examples (few-shot) or some auxiliary information (zero-shot), mimicking human ability. By doing so, the trained model is no longer limited to a pre-defined and fixed set of classes but ideally can generalize to any class of interest with the cost of little human intervention. In addition, few-shot and zero-shot models naturally incorporate human input without asking for significant effort, making them useful tools when developing MIR systems that can be customized by individual users.</p>
<p>In this tutorial, we will go over</p>
<ul>
<li>FSL/ZSL foundations - Task definition and existing approaches.</li>
<li>Recent advances of FSL/ZSL in MIR - Techniques and contributions in recent studies. We will also discuss the remaining challenges and future directions.</li>
<li>Coding examples - Showcasing the training and evaluation pipeline of FSL and ZSL models on specific MIR tasks. Code and references to the tools and datasets will be provided.</li>
</ul>
<p>We aim for this tutorial to be useful to researchers and practitioners in the ISMIR community who are facing labeled data scarcity issues, looking for new interaction paradigms between users and MIR systems, or generally interested in the techniques and applications of FSL and ZSL. We assume the audience is familiar with the basic machine learning concepts.</p>

          <p>Mixing is a central task within audio post-production where expert knowledge is required to deliver professional quality content, encompassing both technical and creative considerations. Recently, deep learning approaches have been introduced that aim to address this challenge by generating a cohesive mixture of a set of recordings as would an audio engineer. These approaches leverage large-scale datasets and therefore have the potential to outperform traditional approaches based on expert systems, but bring their own unique set of challenges. In this tutorial, we will begin by providing an introduction to the mixing process from the perspective of an audio engineer, along with a discussion of the tools used in the process from a signal processing perspective. We will then discuss a series of recent deep learning approaches and relevant datasets, providing code to build, train, and evaluate these systems. Future directions and challenges will be discussed, including new deep learning systems, evaluation methods, and approaches to address dataset availability. Our goal is to provide a starting point for researchers working in MIR who have little to no experience in audio engineering so they can easily begin addressing problems in this domain. In addition, our tutorial may be of interest to researchers outside of MIR, but with a background in audio engineering or signal processing, who are interested in gaining exposure to current approaches in deep learning.</p>

          <p>The MIR community shows an increasing interest in understanding how current technologies affect the everyday experience of people all over the world, e.g., how we listen to music, compose songs, or learn to play an instrument. As it was introduced in the FAT-MIR tutorial held at ISMIR 2019, a great discussion has aroused around the ethical, social, economic, legal, and cultural implications that the use of MIR systems have in our life.</p>
<p>In this tutorial, we aim at building upon and expanding the aforementioned debate, discussing the more recent results obtained by the MIR community and beyond. The goal of the tutorial is to show how values, such as fairness and diversity, can be embedded in the life cycle of MIR systems to make them trustworthy: from algorithmic design to evaluation practices and regulatory proposals. To achieve that, we will discuss examples of, among the others, popularity bias, gender bias, algorithmic bias, music styles underrepresentation, and diversity-related phenomena (e.g. filter bubbles).</p>
<p>This tutorial is suitable for researchers and students in MIR working in any domain, as these issues are relevant for all MIR tasks. The examples will mostly focus on music information retrieval and recommendation, but there are no prerequisites for taking this tutorial. Besides presenting recent research insights, the tutorial will integrate two hands-on sessions, where we will involve the participants in reflecting on the design of evaluation methods that take into account values for which MIR systems should be accountable.</p>
